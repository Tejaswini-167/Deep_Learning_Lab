##Lab 1 â€” Perceptron Binary Classification from Scratch

###Objective
*Implement a perceptron model from scratch using NumPy and visualize the decision boundary using Matplotlib.

###Key Concepts
*Perceptron algorithm
*Linear decision boundary
Effect of learning rate and epochs
Limitation on non-linearly separable data

###Implementation

*Built perceptron using NumPy arrays.
*Used Matplotlib for plotting decision boundary and classification results.
*Trained model on synthetic 2D dataset.

###Results / Observations

*Successfully classified linearly separable data.
*Model failed on non-linear (XOR-like) datasets.
*Higher learning rates led to faster convergence but sometimes unstable boundaries.
