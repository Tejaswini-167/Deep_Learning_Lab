# Lab 2: Feedforward Neural Network

### 📌 Objective
Implement a simple Feedforward Neural Network and train it using backpropagation.

### 📂 Files
- `DL_Lab2.ipynb`: Implementation of forward and backward propagation.

### 📝 Summary
- Designed a neural network with one hidden layer.  
- Implemented forward pass and error calculation.  
- Used gradient descent for parameter updates.  

### 📊 Results
- Achieved ~97% accuracy on sample dataset.  
- Observed training loss decreasing steadily.
